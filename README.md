# Liverpool-RC

The Liverpool-RC project is an advanced autonomous driving robot designed to operate using a Raspberry Pi 5 running Raspberry Pi OS. This platform aims to leverage AI and machine learning techniques to enable the robot to navigate and make decisions in real-time, evolving into a fully autonomous self-driving system. Through continuous training and refinement, the robot will learn to recognize and respond to its environment, ultimately developing the capability to drive independently with minimal human intervention.
