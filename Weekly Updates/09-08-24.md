# Week of September 8th, 2024

## Kajsa Pruner
### This week:
- Created a schedule for the semester so that we have a plan of what we need to do every week, and so that we stay on track.
- Created a google drive where we can store documents that do not need to be placed in Github. For example power points for the presentations can be stored here and easily accessed by everyone.
### Goals:
- Research compatible cameras to use and what packages needed to connect to the Jetson. If have in hand, hook up and verify connection.

## Reagan Graff
### This Week:
- Installed ROS2 Humble on the Jetson and worked on connecting the Raspberry Pi Pico to it. Encountered some issues, which I am currently troubleshooting.
### Goals:
- Resolve connection issues between the Raspberry Pi Pico and Jetson.
- Integrate the RPLIDAR with the Jetson and confirm data collection using the rplidar_ros package.

## Ethan Durham
### This Week:
- Found potential components for design, such as a Logitech camera and a set of 4 McNamum wheels
- Measured the dimensions of the components that were currently on Virgil.
### Goals
- Begin creating/testing a new base design for Virgil.
- Continue to learn more 3D design.
