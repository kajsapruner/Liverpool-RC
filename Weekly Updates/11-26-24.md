### This Week
- Worked on the report. Wrote about the system design for our robot and about the overall system architechture. Also made a table for the connections from the motor driver to the raspberry pi pico to clarify what GPIO pin # goes where.

### Future Goals
- Try to finish up the report sooner or later. I want to work on it during thansgiving so that we can have our draft done in the beginning of next week.
- Just keep checking in with Reagan and Ethan if they need help with something.
