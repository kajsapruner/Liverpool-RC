## Kajsa Pruner
### This Week
- Started working on the Final Report
- Helped troubleshooting the encoder program as well as when our pi stopped working (we had to reflash our sd card)
### Future Goals
- - I want to have a good base on the report until next week so that we feel like we have made good progress on that, and then just need to add potential additional information about progress that we make.
- - Helping to troubleshoot and brainstorm with the encoder program so that we can make this navigation work, since it is 50% of our grade.
